			<h3>25.09.20 - Introduction</h3>
			<p>My career goals began with wanting to be an artist, of the not starving variety, which then lead me to develop interest in Graphic Design. Since then, I have been looking for apprenticeships and any junior positions to try my hand at industry experience. I tried my luck at self-teaching and found it to be an interesting experience which mainly involved experimenting with different designs and layouts. An example of my work can be seen 
				<a href="coursework/Tribute page/biography.html" target="_blank">here</a>. Beware this is not mobile friendly, this was my first website and I designed the main image.
				 In the future, I will be aiming to improve my design abilities and hopefully become skilled in Adobe Illustrator.  However, since joining SAE Institute for the Web Development course, I have been intrigued with web design after looking at a website from 
				 <a href="http://www.elsamuse.com/en/" target="_blank">ELSA MUSE</a>
				 . After studying her website, I learned she uses ‘Canvas’, if I want to make website designs like her I ought to try out her tools too. Wish me luck with JavaScript.</p>

			<h3>6-7.10.20 - Jamstack Conference</h3>
			<p>Today I attended the Jamstack conference. I had never involved myself in the web community and was surprised to see so many people attending. Due to Covid of course, it was online and the way they handled the conference was exceptionally smooth and flowed together nicely, even allowing for chances to network. I was able to network with a dev group that specialised in e-commerce.  It took a little bit of prep, but I was able to ask relevant questions and have a conversation with the Devs that eventually gave me their GitHub. Overall, it was interesting to see how wide the web technologies are, also a glimpse of how fast it evolves.</p>

			<h3>08.10.20 - Learning Style</h3>
			<p>During the past couple of weeks, I have been working primarily on developing my ability to make features for the web both functional and responsive. I have come across the realisation that I love complaining to myself when my code decides not to work, I find that outwardly expressing my frustration (mindful of others, of course) helps me find solutions quicker than if I were to sit and stare at the problem for hours, talking from experience. While completing one of the tasks that my lecturer gave the class, I learnt I was a Kinaesthetic -INFJ Learner, which means that, when learning there must be some sort of physical interaction with the material. I will remember content best through touch…taste or smell? This makes sense given what I said previously. The results came to a bit of a surprise as I had not really noticed my behaviour but once I read through and answered all the quizzes questions, it was clear.

			<h3>23.10.20 - Strengths and Weaknesses</h3>
			<p>While learning flex, I struggled to understand how it worked. I did my best; however, I lean more towards grid.  I believe grid to be my strength as it is easier to visualise and more comfortable to control when using media queries. Furthermore, flexbox has its limitations in terms of allowing for only one layout and you cannot make it in anything other than row and column. Again, since grid can be altered and you can target specific cells, then it is easier to create more dynamic layouts. Despite my preference for grid, I would like to become familiar with flex. </p>

			<h3>27.11.20 - Project Management</h3>
			<p>While coding my website, I realised how easy it is to overshoot. My abilities have not yet reached the point where I could create what I envisioned. I was too ambitious at the start but from my original plan, I have evolved and made it so it is still both doable and unique to me. Also, since learning about SASS and its ability to include variables and mixins, I decided to move all my css files onto it. Cleaning up code is relatively time consuming, but it allows for clearer communication between you and the browser.</p>

			<h3>05.12.20 - Overcoming Challenges</h3>
			<p>Despite my struggle with flex previously, I decided to challenge myself and use it for my website.  I have studied it and believe that it is particularly useful for responsiveness. Furthermore, in regard to design, as stated in my first blog post, I have been able to improve my skills in Adobe Illustrator and designed my own illustration for my websites homepage. Since my first attempt at a website, and my different experiments, as seen in my portfolio page, I have come a long way.</p>
